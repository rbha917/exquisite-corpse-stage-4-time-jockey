## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*When i thought about time i thought of old film reels showing a galloping horse in motion, and as well as seeing the passage of time through destruction and degradation so i decided to combine the two. i kind of went for a 'crazy doomsday timer' aesthetic, and allowed the viewer to 'begin time' through their own interaction with the program. I used a combination of fund images from google for the horses, and photos of photos in a magazine i found on my computer of a collapsing building, and then set up a seconds counter for the doomsday vibe. i was aiming for the feeling of running through time lightheartedly despite the decay of the world as time passes on. *

*Hearing Interactivity, I'm reminded of all the images and information shown to me throughout my day.  A lot of the information I don't want to see, but it is hard not to be forced to see images and ads everywhere.  I thought of the OVERACTIVITY of all the images on random.  We are overloaded with ideas, images, and information every few seconds in life.*

*Right away I knew that I wanted to carry on and build on the idea of over interactivity and show the amount of content we are exposed to everyday, through social media and the internet in general. The checkbox represents the act of clicking online, so once itâ€™s clicked everything pops up onto the screen. I loved the randomness of the different mixes of images so I kept them and changed their opacity so they blended together as a background. I used a few different APIs to draw data from, drew them to the canvas, overlapping to create a confusing list of words and numbers. I also made a CSV file with some random data to create two line graphs adding to the show of data on the screen.
I kept the horse images and the minute counter, to continue the underlying theme of time passing, and to represent how much time can be lost while scrolling or surfing the internet.
I wanted to get across how overwhelming it can feel being online in this day and age. And how we are often bombarded with information, ads and content that we don't necessarily want to see or are interested in.*

*I loved the range of wacky elements that have been added to this code particularly in stages 2 and 3. They inspired me to create a short story-game that was just as wacky and nonsensical. I kept the horse as the protagonist because I wanted to keep this element as it has been integral to all the stages. I used backgrounds from another sketch that I worked on in stage 3 to create different environments along with the collages from stage 2 of this sketch. Then I added buttons at each stage to progress the game into different pathways. I had some difficulty here with making sure the buttons would not clash but with some assistance I learnt that by defining them as global variables I could remove them at the start of each new frame. I wanted there to be more to the game than just selecting between options so if the user ended up on the path where they were stuck with the collages, they would need to search for their way out by finding the checkbox that is hidden in plain sight. The length of the game varies on the user's choices as one button could take them right to the end and the other could take them to the collage. I tried to match the colours of the collages I used to the environment that came before them e.g. snow to snowmix due to the white background. I end with a full circle taking the user to the same field they started in and wrote a cautionary message about eating random items that you find which hopefully the users will be able to tell what I am alluding to in a real world context based on the wackiness of this sketch.*
